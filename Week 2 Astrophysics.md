The code I contributed looks at a detrended lightcurve of an area in the sky. It shows periodical change. To investigate further I created an animation out of TESS pictures. It shows the changing flux of the star indicating an exoplanet or smth similar. To further look into the change of the star's flux it has been isolated and plotted again. The regular change in flux and the two differently sized bumbs every period indicate a binary star system.


// I also tried to work with lightkurve though I always got an KeyError of an invalid coordinate, stackoverflow could not help in this case. It does look very promising though. It simplified many of the procedures seen in the other notebooks relating to lightcurves.


//Furthermore it was not able to figure out how to do all the introductory classes without uploading a specific url.
